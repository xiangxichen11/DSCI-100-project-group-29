    "The data set we will be using contains information on patients, including age, sex, blood pressure, cholestrol levels, and more. These attributes will be used to predict whether a patients has heart disease. In this proposal, will use machine learning algorithms to analyze the dataset and develop predictive models for heart disease diagnosis. The goal of this is to provide a tool to healthcare professionals to assist in early detection of heart disease, thus aiding in the management of heart disease. \n",
